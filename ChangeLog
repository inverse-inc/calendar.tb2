2009-08-21  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/messenger-overlay-sidebar.xul: we
	enable the "export" menu items from the File menu to appear in
	"task" mode.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-common-sets.js: since
	"currentView()" only pertains to calendar views, the
	"calendar_export_selection_command" now checks whether the current
	mode is not actually the "task" mode, in which case the view taken
	into account is the "calendar-task-tree" element.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-task-tree.xml: added new
	"getSelectedItems" method that returns a list of the parent items
	whose children are currently selected in the view. This method
	matches the ones from the "calendar" views in order to facilitate
	the export functions.

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/messenger-overlay-sidebar.xul,
	src/calendar/base/content/calendar-common-sets.js: added files for
	further modifications.

2009-08-18  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-task-tree.xml: added module
	for further modification. Modified to apply the same speedup
	modifications that were done to the other calendar views. Fixed
	the handling of recurring items when adding or removing tasks.
	Fixed batch mode handling to use a counter and avoid any refresh
	when that counter drops to 0.

2009-08-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: fixed a typo that
	prevented the correct loading of the acl for the calendar entry
	matching the invitation. In the same spirit, the
	imipCalDAVComponentACLEntryObserver would not properly handle the
	returned entry URL.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-item-editing.js: added code
	to enable modification of certain events based on their acl, even
	if the user cannot add events to the calendar.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-summary-dialog.js: imported
	module and modified it to set it's readOnly mode based on the
	userCanRespond and userCanModify permissions from CalDAVAclManager.

2009-08-04  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Added src/patches/468846.diff - even if it's a temporary fix
	* src/calendar/providers/storage/calStorageCalendar.js and
	src/calendar/base/src/calTransactionManager.js - we no longer
	reset the partipation status when the attendee's id (ie., the
	email address) is identical to the one from the organizer.

2009-08-04  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js (addDAVItem): A bug was
	introduced in with the fix below, where the metadata would not be
	saved for new items when a listener was not provided. In the case
	of a non-cached calendar, the issue is minor because we lose the
	metadata between sessions. For cached calendars, the presence of a
	listener argument should have no impact.

2009-07-24  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: addDAVItem fixed to not
	add new/updated items directly to the cached calendar but to
	notify the super calendar's listener instead, as done in multiple
	other places when solving bug
	https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=463679. In this case,
	the bug is not totally the same but the underlying mechanism is
	similar. Note that addDAVItem can be used during a refresh
	operation, during which no listener will be provided. We then
	revert to the previous mechanism.

	* src/calendar/providers/storage/calStorageCalendar.js: reverted
	latest patch below as it prevented some operations from being
	completed. Replaced with a better and cleaner fix.

2009-07-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/providers/storage/calStorageCalendar.js
	(adoptItem): avoid a useless notification that triggers a double
	"onAddItem".

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: fixed
	getInvitedAttendee to return the first matching result.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-multiday-view.xml:
	deleteItemsFromCalendar fixed to remove occurrences found in the
	column headers.

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: adapted code to run
	without acl manager, thereby removing dependency on SOGo
	Connector.

2009-07-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: webdav sync: fixed a
	bug that would continuously refresh the inbox.
	Added a patch from Simon Vaillancourt @ Oracle that postpones any
	refresh method prior to an initial delay specified in the
	"calendar.caldav.refresh.initialdelay" setting.
	Fixed the handling of character data, thanks to Simon Vaillancourt.

	* We avoid having view triggering getItems when an "onLoad" or an
	"onEndBatch" notification is received. Instead, we reenable the
	onAddItem, onModifyItem and onDeleteItem callbacks during batch
	mode. This optimization greatly reduces the amount of accesses to
	the cache database and the amount of elements needed to be
	redrawn. (no bugzilla bug report yet)

	* src/calendar/base/src/calCachedCalendar.js: we prevent the
	cached calendar from refreshing at initialization, because the
	registration mechanism must take care of some things beforehand.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calCalendarManager.js: initial cached
	calendars won't have a name, we initialize thus to "" to avoid
	errors during onCalendarAdded callbacks. The registerCalendar
	method set the uncached version in its cache, we fix this to avoid
	further reference errors. We then refresh it.

2009-07-21  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: an exception occurs
	when retrieving itip item containing a recurrence-id without a
	master occurence. The exception is caught and we avoid displaying
	the imip bar at that moment.
	Fixed a case where no user calendars belonging to the user would
	be found.

2009-07-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/providers/composite/calCompositeCalendar.js:
	inhibit the prevention of getItems on non-cached-and-caldav
	calendars.

2009-07-19  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: show a spinning
	wheel until the proper message and buttons can be displayed. The
	"requiresNetwork" property is not available on caldav calendars.
	Therefore we only test for the calendar type for updating them.
	Fixed exceptions occuring with CANCEL and REPLY messages.
	Spinning wheel bugs:
	  - a CANCEL request may sometime refer at first to an event that
	    has already been deleted from the calendar, we ignore it in
	    that case.

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar-overlay.xul: extracted
	file for further modifications.

2009-07-17  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calCachedCalendar.js: commented out the
	update timer for cached calendars, since the timer for the views
	already achieves the same effect.

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: make better use of
	the CalDAV acls. Ensure the calendars are updated before searching
	the related event.

2009-07-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-ui-utils.js: extracted file
	for further modification
	(appendCalendarItems) add a "tooltiptext" to the calendar menu
	items for large calendar names.

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog.xul: (new
	file) assigned "id" field and value to the status bar privacy
	labels.

2009-07-09  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: it may happen that ACL
	are loaded before the refresh starts. In that case, we used to
	wait indefinitely for the a notification that has already passed.
	This is now fixed.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-task-editing.js: check the
	value of getSelectedCalendar() to avoid exceptions on null values.

2009-07-08  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: webdav sync handler: we
	trigger the "endBatch" event BEFORE the finalization of the
	update to avoid locking problems in the cache database.
	Also, we don't need to test for the presence of the
	changeLogListener in the mACLRefreshData ivar, only for the ivar
	itself.
	The acl manager is only instantiated once, we can thus use it later
	as indicator to whether it is available or not. We also allow
	write access to calendars without ACL support.

	* src/calendar/providers/composite/calCompositeCalendar.js
	(getItems): instead of testing each calendar to see whether it's
	ready, we only take the "readyCalendars" into account. This
	enables views to receive an onOperationComplete event when no
	calendar is available yet.
	(calCompositeGetListenerHelper): the amount of pending requests
	depends on the amount of enabled calendars that are declared ready.
	(readyCalendars): new accessor that returns the amount of enabled
	calendars that are declared ready.

2009-07-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: the observe method was
	modified to handle the new "caldav-acl-reset" notification. The
	code was also simplified by triggering a refresh whenever the
	mACLRefreshData ivar is set.
	Completed the webdav sync implementation by handling the case
	where a 403 error code would be return with a "valid-sync-token"
	DAV error.

2009-07-06  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/providers/composite/calCompositeCalendar.js: when
	calendars implement calISyncCalendar, we don't allow getItems
	operations on them as long as they are not "loaded".

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: bypass safeRefresh as
	long as the ACLs are not loaded (Inverse edition).

2009-07-03  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/agenda-listbox.js
	(deleteItemsFromCalendar): we cannot duplicate the array of nodes
	with Array.splice with Mozilla 1.8, therefore we wander the
	nodeList reversely.

2009-07-03  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Added patch for bug #453145

2009-07-02  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js (safeRefresh): fixed
	issues with unavailable calendars. (#502014)

2009-06-30  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calIcsParser.js: added a new
	"sanitizeICSValue" that pre-parse the ICS string in order to fix
	errors that are not handled by libical.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calStorageCalendar.js (writeEvent): be
	tolerant for events which don't have a start or an end date.
	Replace them with an empty string.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: webdav sync: do not try
	to delete items which are not present in the item id cache. Added
	new "finalizeUpdatedItems" with code executed when a safeRefresh
	is concluded. Call that new method from the
	getUpdatedItem_WebdavSync method too.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calCalendarManager.js: we do not post
	"onCalendarRegistered" notifications on new calendars before their
	cache is initialized.

2009-06-29  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-invitations-manager.js:
	only refreshs the enabled calendars (first inclusion).

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-multiday-view.xml
	(deleteItemsFromCalendar): duplicate the mEventInfos array so as
	to be able to wander through the array "normally" without having
	to keep the index count up-to-date.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-month-view.xml
	(deleteItemsFromCalendar): use the "deleteHash" only to flag the
	current item as deleted.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-minimonth-busy.js
	(parseBoxBusy, updateBoxBusy): use "\u001a" as separator instead
	of ";".: 

	* src/calendar/base/content/agenda-listbox.js
	(agendaListbox.deleteItemsFromCalendar) duplicate the childNodes
	array so that we can delete the childNode directly without having
	to maintain an index count.

2009-06-26  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-unifinder.js,
	src/calendar/base/content/agenda-listbox.js,
	src/calendar/base/content/calendar-minimonth-busy.js,
	src/calendar/base/content/calendar-month-view.xml,
	src/calendar/base/content/calendar-multiday-view.xml: modified
	onCalendarAdded and /-Removed to add or delete items from the
	relevant calendar only. (fixes #500718)

2009-06-19  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: implemented webdav sync
	spec support. (implements #498690 and makes #498731 a non-issue)

	* Bumped version to v0.9.4
