2010-07-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-summary-dialog.js:
	(saveDelegationInfo): we remove the first delegate only after the
	delegation chain has been requested. Otherwise that chain will
	always be empty, leaving the responded invitation in an
	inconsistent state.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-item-editing.js:
	(findDelegationAttendees): we now return an array as it keeps the
	delegation chain sorted.

2010-07-13  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-attendees.js:
	(freeBusyCacheEntry): we now pass the calId as parameter.
	(freeBusyCacheEntry.getEntries): we simply check that the
	"interval" member of each entries is available, altough the
	contrary should never happen.
	(freeBusyCacheEntry.integrateEntries): when aEntries is null, we
	create a mock array with a single fb interval with a type of
	"UNKNOWN".
	(conflictHandler.onResult): returns a conflict only for "BUSY"
	entries, ignoring anything else.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calFreeBusyService.js:
	(calFreeBusyListener.onResult) we invoke notifyResult even if
	"aResult" is null, to avoid breaking the chain of events.

2010-06-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-common-sets.js
	(calendarController.doCommand): the delete command is sometimes a
	"cmd_delete", directed at a different view than the calendar
	views. In that case, we must not display the confirmation dialog.
	Additionally, the confirmation dialog for event deletion would
	appear when deleting tasks, therefore with the wrong wording.

2010-06-14  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/clipboard.js (copyToClipboard): we
	ensure the recurrenceId attribute is set to null prior to copying
	the element to the clipboard, to avoid further parsing errors from
	the buggy ICS Parser provided with Lightning.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-unifinder.js:
	(unifinderTreeView.removeItems): since the row indexes are not
	recomputed after each removal, they are stacked in an array which
	is sorted afterwards and then wandered backwards in order to
	perform the actual removal with the proper index.

2010-06-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/lightning.js: disabled the
	default value for "calendar.categories.names" as it is defined in
	the locale files and risk overriding the default value in other
	custom modules.

	* src/calendar/base/content/preferences/categories.js:
	(gCategoriesPane.init): extracted the categories initialisation
	code into its own method named "loadCategoryList".
	(gCategoriesPane.resetCategories): new action method that resets
	the categories list to the defaults if modified by the user.

2010-06-09  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-view-core.xml
	(calendar-editable-item.startEditing): don't attempt to hide the
	event location label if it's null.

2010-06-08  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js (sendItems): removed
	duplicate "Recipient" header for participant recipients. Also,
	NON-PARTICIPANT recipients must continue receiving email
	exchanges.

2010-05-21  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-attendees.js:
	(conflictHandler._readFreeBusy): invokes "this.onResult" directly
	when entries are available from the cache.

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-freebusy.xml:
	(freebusy-grid.nextSlot): we shift the start date when its hours
	component passes over the day end hour.

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-attendees.js:
	(onNextSlot) removed the handling of the time range menu, which
	was removed. Moved the time range code into "initTimeRange".

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-task-tree.xml:
	(calendar-task-tree.mTaskTreeObserver.onAdditem)
	(calendar-task-tree.mTaskTreeObserver.onModifyitem): prevent
	GUI operations for items in calendars that should not appear in
	the today pane.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-item-editing.js:
	(doTransaction): add an entry to the new global
	"gActiveOperations" dictionary when a transaction is in progress
	so that two transactions cannot occur concurrently on the same
	item.

2010-05-18  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-multiday-view.xml:
	(calendar-event-box.setEditableLabel) set the value of the
	location label if the item contains such a value.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-view-core.xml:
	(calendar-editable-item.eventLocationLabel): new accessor that
	returns the new XUL:element representing the event location.
	(calendar-editable-item.startEditing)
	(calendar-editable-item.stopEditing): hide and show the new event
	location label.

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-attendees.js:
	(onAccept): added code to prevent the closing of the window, check
	the freebusy of every attendee and prompt a conflict dialog if
	needed.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-unifinder.js:
	(unifinderKeyPress): see below.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-common-sets.js:
	(calendarController.doCommand): see below.

	* src/calendar/base/content/agenda-listbox.js:
	(agendaListbox.onKeyPress:) prompt a confirmation dialog before
	deleting events.

2010-05-17  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-freebusy.xml:
	(freebusy-grid.setRange): new accessor that sets the lower and
	upper limits between which the potential event should fit.
	(freebusy-grid.initTimeRange): decoupled "mStartHour/mEndHour" and
	"mRangeXXXHour/Minute", the former being used only for choosing
	which hours are displayed and the latter being used to determine a
	time range in which the event should fit. They may or may not have
	the same value.

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-attendees.js:
	(onLoad): initialize the new time range widgets with the values of
	the event start and end time.
	(onNextSlot): invoke the new "setRange" method on the freebusy
	grid widget with the values corresponding to the current time
	range settings.
	(onTimeRange): new callback for displaying or hiding the time
	fields depending on the value of the time range popup menu.

2010-05-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-freebusy.xml:
	(freebusy-grid.nextSlot): we now deduce and cache offdays in
	"this.mOffdays".
	(freebusy-grid.nextSlot): the end hour of the current event may
	match the end hour of the current day as long as the end minute is
	0. Also, we ensure that the resulting period does not overlap with
	off days.

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-attendees.js:
	(freeBusyRequestListener, freeBusyCacheEntry)
	(freeBusyRowController): new classes for handling cached freebusy entries.

2010-05-06  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-properties-dialog.js:
	(onLoad, onAcceptDialog): added code to retrieve and save the
	"includeInFreeBusy" on calendar that support it.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js
	(supportsFreeBusyTransparency, includeInFreeBusy): new properties
	that handles the availability and the value of the
	"schedule-calendar-transp" property.

2010-05-05  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-attendees.xml:
	(attendees-list._resolveListByName): a bug in the exception
	handling would prevent the search from happening on any other than
	the first addressbook.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calTransactionManager.js
	(resetAttendeeStatus): we don't reset the attendee status to
	"NEEDS-ACTION" if its role is "NON-PARTICIPANT". We also no longer
	set its role to "REQ-PARTICIPANT", as the organizer may have
	chosen to assign it another role.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-summary-dialog.js:
	(saveDelegationInfo): the "item-delegate-staytuned" checkbox is now
	disable in the template, since it is not properly handled yet.
	(updateAttendees): attendees are now displayed one by line to
	avoid the delegation text from overlapping the rest of the list.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-item-editing.js
	(checkAndSendItipMessage): Fixed a typo. When constructing the
	itip item, we avoid setting rsvp and the participation status for
	attendee having their role set to "NON-PARTICIPANT".

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-attendees.js
	(onAttrModified): catch the moment when the focus is lost from an
	attendee input field and invoke "resolvePotentialList" on it. Keep
	a reference of the last checked value to not verify the same entry
	twice.

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-attendees.xml
	(attendees-list.resolvePotentialList): new method, designed to
	resolve contact lists and decompose them in individual freebusy
	entries.

2010-05-03  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calTransactionManager.js
	We make sure that the organizer is not null when
	resetting the participation status.

2010-04-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog.js
	(setShowTimeAs): all day events should be opaque by default.

2010-04-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-summary-dialog.js: added
	missing translations.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calUtils.js (calGetString): instead of
	returning a useless failure string, we return the property key
	instead. This enables the same behaviour as with gettext.

2010-03-31  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-task-tree.xml
	(calendar-task-tree.refresh): we enable the "aCompleteRefresh"
	argument only when the current calendar in the loop is the first
	one, otherwise, the shown tasks will only be those of the latest
	in the list.

2010-03-31  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-summary-dialog.xul
	Fixed typo which would prevent setting a reminder of
	1 week for received invitations

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-item-editing.js
	Modified the checkAndSendItipMessage() function so that
	if the part-state is the same and the delegated-to is
	the same, we just don't send any invitatation reply.
	This was causing major pain when simply setting a reminder
	to an invitation email.

2010-03-30  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js (checkServerCaps): SOGo
	provides a "false" inbox too but the caldav provider handles it
	wrong. In particular, the inbox "calendar" is not a separate
	instance, which causes an overwrite of the metadata when a regular
	calendar and its corresponding inbox are updated.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-task-tree.xml
	(calendar-task-tree.mTaskTreeObserver.onPropertyChanged): take the
	"showInTodayPane" property into account, if this tree is part of
	the today-pane.
	(calendar-task-tree.mustShowInTaskTree): new method that returns
	true if the id of the current tree is "unifinder-todo-tree" and
	the calendar passed as parameter has its "showInTodayPane"
	propery set.

2010-03-25  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-attendees.js
	(onLoad): restore the width of the attendees and freebusy
	containers, saved from the new "saveWidgets" methods.

2010-03-24  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-item-bindings.xml
	(item-date-row.Item): instead of keeping their original timezone
	and displaying it, the dates are now displayed according to the
	user timezone.

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/messenger-overlay-sidebar.js
	(gInvitationsCalendarManagerObserver): enhanced with interface
	calIObserver so that the new "showInvitations" parameter is taken
	directly into account (via notification).

	* src/calendar/base/content/agenda-listbox.js
	(agendaListbox.refreshCalendarQuery): hacked to refresh items only
	from calendars having the property "showInTodayPane" set to true.
	(agendaListbox.calendarObserver.onPropertyChanged): take
	"showInTodayPane" into account and ignore "disable" since the
	latter is useless because onCalendarAdded and onCalendarRemoved
	already take care of its purpose.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-unifinder.js
	(unifinderObserve.onCalendarAdded)
	(unifinderObserve.onCalendarRemoved): check whether the unifinder
	is visible before executing any update, in order to avoid useless
	calls of getItems().

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-multiday-view.xml: same as below.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-month-view.xml
	(calendar-month-view.isActiveView): new method that determines
	whether the current instance is the active view.
	(calendar-month-view.refresh, calendar-month-view.onCalendarAdded)
	(calendar-month-view.onCalendarRemoved): make use of the new
	method above to reduce the amount of invocations of getItems.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-minimonth-busy.js
	(minimonthBusyListener.onCalendarAdded)
	(minimonthBusyListener.onCalendarRemoved): we now return directly, to
	avoid updating the minimonth with costly getItems.
	(minimonthBusyListener.onAddItem)
	(minimonthBusyListener.onDeleteItem)
	(minimonthBusyListener.onModifyItem): we also return directly
	here, to avoid a UI inconsistency where any change to an event
	would cause the boldening of the referred dates.

2010-03-23  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calIcsParser.js
	We fallback to ISO8859-1 when UTF-8 fails
	for ICS import.

	* Added
	src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-attendees.js
	and src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog-attendees.xul
	and backported patch from bug #367359
	Also set the default zoom to 200%.

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog.{js,xul}
	Added the "Show Time as Free" checkbox in the main event
	editing window.

2010-02-19  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-item-editing.js
	Small fix in openEventDialog() so event editing works
	with local calendars.
	* Bumped version number to v0.9.9

2010-02-02  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-item-editing.js
	(openEventDialog): allow event editing when the acl manager is not present.

2010-02-01  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-item-editing.js
	(openEventDialog): we must check the ACL of an event even when
	isCalendarWritable returns false, since modification of an event
	can still be granted even though the calendar is read-only to the
	current user. Reimplemented the old versoin of isCalendarWritable,
	without the ACL code, with the name "isCalendarAvailable" for that
	purpose.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-summary-dialog.js (onLoad):
	we must test whether the entry ACL has been filled before invoking
	its accessors. This situation can happen when the acl manager has
	never been invoked, for a read-only calendar.
	(onAccept): we now check whether the instance being editted is an
	event before saving delegation information. This solves a bug
	where summary dialog fails to close when displaying a task.

2010-01-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-item-editing.js
	(openEventDialog): enable the fetching of ACL on events when the
	parent calendar IS writable. Furthermore, the fact that a calendar
	is writable should not preclude the code from checking the
	modification write when choosing the window to display.

2009-12-01  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Reworked the "Meeting" category for the
	English and French locale.

2009-11-26  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Added src/patches/468846_oracle.diff - which
	was missing in previous commits
	* src/calendar/providers/storage/calStorageCalendar.js
	Modified initDB() to create indexes as mentioned in
	https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=529326
	This speeds up initial loading of cached CalDAV
	calendars and subsequent TB starts.
	* Bumped version number to 0.9.8pre1

2009-10-27  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Added checks in case start/end date isn't defined so
	we do not throw worthless exceptions and stop.

2009-10-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js
	(imipCalDAVComponentACLEntryObserver.observe): use
	"this.componentURL" to retrieve the base filename of the component
	rather than the full url.

2009-08-31  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* Added support for iTIP delegation.

2009-08-21  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/messenger-overlay-sidebar.xul: we
	enable the "export" menu items from the File menu to appear in
	"task" mode.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-common-sets.js: since
	"currentView()" only pertains to calendar views, the
	"calendar_export_selection_command" now checks whether the current
	mode is not actually the "task" mode, in which case the view taken
	into account is the "calendar-task-tree" element.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-task-tree.xml: added new
	"getSelectedItems" method that returns a list of the parent items
	whose children are currently selected in the view. This method
	matches the ones from the "calendar" views in order to facilitate
	the export functions.

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/messenger-overlay-sidebar.xul,
	src/calendar/base/content/calendar-common-sets.js: added files for
	further modifications.

2009-08-18  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-task-tree.xml: added module
	for further modification. Modified to apply the same speedup
	modifications that were done to the other calendar views. Fixed
	the handling of recurring items when adding or removing tasks.
	Fixed batch mode handling to use a counter and avoid any refresh
	when that counter drops to 0.

2009-08-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: fixed a typo that
	prevented the correct loading of the acl for the calendar entry
	matching the invitation. In the same spirit, the
	imipCalDAVComponentACLEntryObserver would not properly handle the
	returned entry URL.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-item-editing.js: added code
	to enable modification of certain events based on their acl, even
	if the user cannot add events to the calendar.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-summary-dialog.js: imported
	module and modified it to set it's readOnly mode based on the
	userCanRespond and userCanModify permissions from CalDAVAclManager.

2009-08-04  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Added src/patches/468846.diff - even if it's a temporary fix
	* src/calendar/providers/storage/calStorageCalendar.js and
	src/calendar/base/src/calTransactionManager.js - we no longer
	reset the partipation status when the attendee's id (ie., the
	email address) is identical to the one from the organizer.

2009-08-04  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js (addDAVItem): A bug was
	introduced in with the fix below, where the metadata would not be
	saved for new items when a listener was not provided. In the case
	of a non-cached calendar, the issue is minor because we lose the
	metadata between sessions. For cached calendars, the presence of a
	listener argument should have no impact.

2009-07-24  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: addDAVItem fixed to not
	add new/updated items directly to the cached calendar but to
	notify the super calendar's listener instead, as done in multiple
	other places when solving bug
	https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=463679. In this case,
	the bug is not totally the same but the underlying mechanism is
	similar. Note that addDAVItem can be used during a refresh
	operation, during which no listener will be provided. We then
	revert to the previous mechanism.

	* src/calendar/providers/storage/calStorageCalendar.js: reverted
	latest patch below as it prevented some operations from being
	completed. Replaced with a better and cleaner fix.

2009-07-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/providers/storage/calStorageCalendar.js
	(adoptItem): avoid a useless notification that triggers a double
	"onAddItem".

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: fixed
	getInvitedAttendee to return the first matching result.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-multiday-view.xml:
	deleteItemsFromCalendar fixed to remove occurrences found in the
	column headers.

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: adapted code to run
	without acl manager, thereby removing dependency on SOGo
	Connector.

2009-07-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: webdav sync: fixed a
	bug that would continuously refresh the inbox.
	Added a patch from Simon Vaillancourt @ Oracle that postpones any
	refresh method prior to an initial delay specified in the
	"calendar.caldav.refresh.initialdelay" setting.
	Fixed the handling of character data, thanks to Simon Vaillancourt.

	* We avoid having view triggering getItems when an "onLoad" or an
	"onEndBatch" notification is received. Instead, we reenable the
	onAddItem, onModifyItem and onDeleteItem callbacks during batch
	mode. This optimization greatly reduces the amount of accesses to
	the cache database and the amount of elements needed to be
	redrawn. (no bugzilla bug report yet)

	* src/calendar/base/src/calCachedCalendar.js: we prevent the
	cached calendar from refreshing at initialization, because the
	registration mechanism must take care of some things beforehand.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calCalendarManager.js: initial cached
	calendars won't have a name, we initialize thus to "" to avoid
	errors during onCalendarAdded callbacks. The registerCalendar
	method set the uncached version in its cache, we fix this to avoid
	further reference errors. We then refresh it.

2009-07-21  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: an exception occurs
	when retrieving itip item containing a recurrence-id without a
	master occurence. The exception is caught and we avoid displaying
	the imip bar at that moment.
	Fixed a case where no user calendars belonging to the user would
	be found.

2009-07-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/providers/composite/calCompositeCalendar.js:
	inhibit the prevention of getItems on non-cached-and-caldav
	calendars.

2009-07-19  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: show a spinning
	wheel until the proper message and buttons can be displayed. The
	"requiresNetwork" property is not available on caldav calendars.
	Therefore we only test for the calendar type for updating them.
	Fixed exceptions occuring with CANCEL and REPLY messages.
	Spinning wheel bugs:
	  - a CANCEL request may sometime refer at first to an event that
	    has already been deleted from the calendar, we ignore it in
	    that case.

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar-overlay.xul: extracted
	file for further modifications.

2009-07-17  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calCachedCalendar.js: commented out the
	update timer for cached calendars, since the timer for the views
	already achieves the same effect.

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: make better use of
	the CalDAV acls. Ensure the calendars are updated before searching
	the related event.

2009-07-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-ui-utils.js: extracted file
	for further modification
	(appendCalendarItems) add a "tooltiptext" to the calendar menu
	items for large calendar names.

	* src/calendar/base/content/sun-calendar-event-dialog.xul: (new
	file) assigned "id" field and value to the status bar privacy
	labels.

2009-07-09  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: it may happen that ACL
	are loaded before the refresh starts. In that case, we used to
	wait indefinitely for the a notification that has already passed.
	This is now fixed.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-task-editing.js: check the
	value of getSelectedCalendar() to avoid exceptions on null values.

2009-07-08  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: webdav sync handler: we
	trigger the "endBatch" event BEFORE the finalization of the
	update to avoid locking problems in the cache database.
	Also, we don't need to test for the presence of the
	changeLogListener in the mACLRefreshData ivar, only for the ivar
	itself.
	The acl manager is only instantiated once, we can thus use it later
	as indicator to whether it is available or not. We also allow
	write access to calendars without ACL support.

	* src/calendar/providers/composite/calCompositeCalendar.js
	(getItems): instead of testing each calendar to see whether it's
	ready, we only take the "readyCalendars" into account. This
	enables views to receive an onOperationComplete event when no
	calendar is available yet.
	(calCompositeGetListenerHelper): the amount of pending requests
	depends on the amount of enabled calendars that are declared ready.
	(readyCalendars): new accessor that returns the amount of enabled
	calendars that are declared ready.

2009-07-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: the observe method was
	modified to handle the new "caldav-acl-reset" notification. The
	code was also simplified by triggering a refresh whenever the
	mACLRefreshData ivar is set.
	Completed the webdav sync implementation by handling the case
	where a 403 error code would be return with a "valid-sync-token"
	DAV error.

2009-07-06  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/providers/composite/calCompositeCalendar.js: when
	calendars implement calISyncCalendar, we don't allow getItems
	operations on them as long as they are not "loaded".

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: bypass safeRefresh as
	long as the ACLs are not loaded (Inverse edition).

2009-07-03  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/agenda-listbox.js
	(deleteItemsFromCalendar): we cannot duplicate the array of nodes
	with Array.splice with Mozilla 1.8, therefore we wander the
	nodeList reversely.

2009-07-03  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Added patch for bug #453145

2009-07-02  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	issues with unavailable calendars. (#502014)

2009-06-30  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/src/calIcsParser.js: added a new
	"sanitizeICSValue" that pre-parse the ICS string in order to fix
	errors that are not handled by libical.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calStorageCalendar.js (writeEvent): be
	tolerant for events which don't have a start or an end date.
	Replace them with an empty string.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calDavCalendar.js: webdav sync: do not try
	to delete items which are not present in the item id cache. Added
	new "finalizeUpdatedItems" with code executed when a safeRefresh
	is concluded. Call that new method from the
	getUpdatedItem_WebdavSync method too.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calCalendarManager.js: we do not post
	"onCalendarRegistered" notifications on new calendars before their
	cache is initialized.

2009-06-29  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-invitations-manager.js:
	only refreshs the enabled calendars (first inclusion).

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-multiday-view.xml
	(deleteItemsFromCalendar): duplicate the mEventInfos array so as
	to be able to wander through the array "normally" without having
	to keep the index count up-to-date.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-month-view.xml
	(deleteItemsFromCalendar): use the "deleteHash" only to flag the
	current item as deleted.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-minimonth-busy.js
	(parseBoxBusy, updateBoxBusy): use "\u001a" as separator instead
	of ";".:

	* src/calendar/base/content/agenda-listbox.js
	(agendaListbox.deleteItemsFromCalendar) duplicate the childNodes
	array so that we can delete the childNode directly without having
	to maintain an index count.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-unifinder.js,
